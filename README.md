## Introduction
 *Friend Finder* is a very easy to use friend matching applicantion. As the user particpates, he or she will be asked a series of 
 questions, and asked to respond with values in a range from 1(Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). When the answers are   sumbited a comparison is made with an existing record to determine the best match. The match with the closet set of responses,
 from the 10 questions is identified as the best match. 
 This applicaiotn was developed using *Node.js*, *Express Server*, and *Heroku* on the backend and *HTML*,and *Bootstrap*, and  *CSS*, on the frontend.*
